For this assignment, you will develop both ends of a very simple network-enabled chat application. The server project will launch a network service that listens for incoming connections. The client will connect to the server. Once the connection has been established, the user on the client side will be able to send a message to the server and the user on the server side will be able to send a message to the client.


The code later had to be translated into Python, Java and Rust to compare commonalities among the networking programming.
